Bitcoin Investment Alert

This program calculates the value of your Bitcoin investment in USD 
and alerts you if it falls below $30,000.

Steps:
1. Define a function to convert Bitcoin to USD.
2. Use the function to check if the investment is below $30,000.
3. Print an alert message if the value is too low.

Assumption: 1 Bitcoin = $40,000

    return bitcoin_amount * bitcoin_value_usd

# Calculate investment value in USD
investment_in_usd = bitcoin_to_usd(investment_in_bitcoin, bitcoin_to_usd)

# Check if investment falls below $30,000
if investment_in_usd < 30000:
    print(" Alert: Your Bitcoin investment is below $30,000!")
else:
